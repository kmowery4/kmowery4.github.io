<div class="history">
  <p>Oakdale Hotel is an upper-class hotel located in Miami, Florida. It is elegant and can be seen as expensive but clean. It is family friendly, due to the hotel having their own private pool. The hotel is able to provide valet service, room service for 24 hours a day, a bar downstairs, and laundry in the room for the suites on the top two floors of the hotel and a full work out room for long term guests.</p>
  <p>The Oakdale Hotel was founded by Jane Cordario and her family. They have loved Florida for as long as Jane can remember and chose to grow the family business in Miami and wanted to create an unique family friendly environment. Jane fell in love with her husband, Brian, in their hometown, Oakdale. She wanted to carry on the name and wanted others to enjoy the love she has for Oakdale. Jane and her family hope you and your family can enjoy the hotel as much as she loves running it.</p>
  <p>We hope you enjoy your stay at the Oakdale Hotel.</p>
  <p>Sincerely,</p>
  <h3>Jane Cordario</h3>
